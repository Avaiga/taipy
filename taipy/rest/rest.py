        Initialize a REST API server.

        A Flask application is instantiated and configured using three parameters from the global
        config.
            - Config.global_config.testing (bool): Run the application on testing mode.
            - Config.global_config.env (Optional[str]): The application environment.
            - Config.global_config.secret_key (Optional[str]): Application server secret key.

        However, editing these parameters is only recommended for advanced users. Indeed, the default behavior of the
        REST server without any required configuration satisfies all the standard and basic needs.
