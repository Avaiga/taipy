class CoreEventConsumerBase(threading.Thread):
    """Abstract base class for implementing a Core event consumer.

    This class provides a framework for consuming events from a queue in a separate thread.
    It should be subclassed, and the `process_event` method should be implemented to define
    the custom logic for handling incoming events.

    Example usage:

    ```python
    class MyEventConsumer(CoreEventConsumerBase):
        def process_event(self, event: Event):
            # Custom event processing logic here
            print(f"Received event created at : {event.creation_date}")
            pass

    consumer = MyEventConsumer("consumer_1", event_queue)
    consumer.start()
    # ...
    consumer.stop()
    ```

    Subclasses should implement the `process_event` method to define their specific event handling behavior.

    Attributes:
        queue (SimpleQueue): The queue from which events will be consumed.
