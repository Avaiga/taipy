    Partials are used when you need to use a partial page content in different
    and not related pages. This allows not to have to repeat yourself when
    creating your page templates.

    Visual elements such as [`part`](../../../../../refmans/gui/viselements/generic/part.md),
    [`dialog`](../../../../../refmans/gui/viselements/generic/dialog.md) or
    [`pane`](../../../../../refmans/gui/viselements/generic/pane.md) can use Partials.

    Note that `Partial` has no constructor (no `__init__()` method): to create a
    `Partial`, you must call the `Gui.add_partial()^` function.

    Partials can be really handy if you want to modify a section of a page:
    the `update_content()` method dynamically update pages that make use
    of this `Partial` therefore making it easy to change the content of
    any page, at any moment.
