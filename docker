This is a quick guide on how to work on Taipy using Docker!

  1.Install Docker (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
  2.Create a Dockerfile inside the directory where Taipy is located in your PC.
          DockerFile

          FROM python:3.9

          # Set the working directory in the container
          WORKDIR /app

          # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
          COPY . /app

          # Install any needed dependencies specified in requirements.txt
          RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

          # Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
          EXPOSE 80

          # Run app.py when the container launches
          CMD ["python", "app.py"]

  3.Create a requirements.txt file listing all the Python dependency packages that Taipy uses.
  4.Docker Image build. Open cmd navigate to the directory with Taipy files, Dockerfile and requirements.txt and run:

                    
                    docker build -t taipy.app
  5.Run the docker 
                    .
                    docker run -p 4000:80 taipy-app

  Your Docker is ready! Access it with navigating to "http://localhost:4000".
