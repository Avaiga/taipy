## ‚öôÔ∏è Quickstart
To install Taipy stable release run:
```bash
pip install taipy
```

To install Taipy on a Conda Environment or from source, please refer to the [Installation Guide](https://docs.taipy.io/en/latest/installation/).<br />
To get started with Taipy, please refer to the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.taipy.io/en/latest/getting_started/).

## üîå Scenario and Data Management

Let's create a scenario in Taipy that allows you to filter movie data based on your chosen genre.<br />
This scenario is designed as a straightforward pipeline.<br />
Every time you change your genre selection, the scenario runs to process your request.<br />
It then displays the top seven most popular movies in that genre.

<br />

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep in mind, in this example, we're using a very basic pipeline that consists of just one task. However,<br />
> Taipy is capable of handling much more complex pipelines üöÄ

<br />

Below is our filter function. This is a typical Python function and it's the only task used in this scenario.

```python
def filter_genre(initial_dataset: pd.DataFrame, selected_genre):
    filtered_dataset = initial_dataset[initial_dataset['genres'].str.contains(selected_genre)]
    filtered_data = filtered_dataset.nlargest(7, 'Popularity %')
    return filtered_data
```

This is the execution graph of the scenario we are implementing

</p>

### Taipy Studio
You can use the Taipy Studio extension in Visual Studio Code to configure your scenario with no code<br />
Your configuration is automatically saved as a TOML file.<br />
Check out Taipy Studio [Documentation](https://docs.taipy.io/en/latest/manuals/studio/)

For more advanced use cases or if you prefer coding your configurations instead of using Taipy Studio,<br />
Check out the movie genre demo scenario creation with this [Demo](https://docs.taipy.io/en/latest/knowledge_base/demos/movie_genre_selector/).

## User Interface Generation and Scenario & Data Management
This simple Taipy application demonstrates how to create a basic film recommendation system using Taipy.<br />
The application filters a dataset of films based on the user's selected genre and displays the top seven films in that genre by popularity.
Here is the full code for both the frontend and backend of the application.

```python
import taipy as tp
import pandas as pd
from taipy import Config, Scope, Gui

# Taipy Scenario & Data Management

# Filtering function - task
def filter_genre(initial_dataset: pd.DataFrame, selected_genre):
    filtered_dataset = initial_dataset[initial_dataset["genres"].str.contains(selected_genre)]
    filtered_data = filtered_dataset.nlargest(7, "Popularity %")
    return filtered_data

# Load the configuration made with Taipy Studio
Config.load("config.toml")
scenario_cfg = Config.scenarios["scenario"]

# Start Taipy Core service
tp.Core().run()

# Create a scenario
scenario = tp.create_scenario(scenario_cfg)


# Taipy User Interface
# Let's add a GUI to our Scenario Management for a full application

# Callback definition - submits scenario with genre selection
def on_genre_selected(state):
    scenario.selected_genre_node.write(state.selected_genre)
    tp.submit(scenario)
    state.df = scenario.filtered_data.read()

# Get list of genres
genres = [
    "Action", "Adventure", "Animation", "Children", "Comedy", "Fantasy", "IMAX"
    "Romance","Sci-FI", "Western", "Crime", "Mystery", "Drama", "Horror", "Thriller", "Film-Noir","War", "Musical", "Documentary"
    ]

# Initialization of variables
df = pd.DataFrame(columns=["Title", "Popularity %"])
selected_genre = "Action"

## Set initial value to Action
def on_init(state):
    on_genre_selected(state)

# User interface definition
my_page = """
# Film recommendation

## Choose your favorite genre
<|{selected_genre}|selector|lov={genres}|on_change=on_genre_selected|dropdown|>

## Here are the top seven picks by popularity
<|{df}|chart|x=Title|y=Popularity %|type=bar|title=Film Popularity|>
"""

Gui(page=my_page).run()
```

And the final result:
