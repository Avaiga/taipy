## Testing

### Setting Up the Testing Environment

#### Installing Required Tools
To get started with testing, you need to install `pytest` and `playwright`. You can install these tools using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pytest playwright
```

#### Setting Up Playwright
After installing `playwright`, you need to install the necessary browser binaries:

```bash
playwright install
```

### Writing Tests

#### Backend Tests
Backend tests focus on the logic and functionality of your application. Here’s an example of a backend test using `pytest`:

```python
def test_backend_function():
    result = backend_function()
    assert result == expected_value
```

#### Rendering Tests
Rendering tests ensure that your GUI renders correctly. Here’s an example of a rendering test using `playwright`:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def test_rendering():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch()
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto('http://localhost:8000')
        assert page.title() == "Expected Title"
        browser.close()
```

#### Communication Tests
Communication tests check if the correct callbacks are invoked when user events occur. Here’s an example:

```python
def test_callback_invocation():
    # Setup your GUI and mock the callback
    gui_instance = setup_gui()
    mock_callback = Mock()
    gui_instance.on_event('event_name', mock_callback)

    # Trigger the event
    gui_instance.trigger_event('event_name')

    # Assert the callback was invoked
    mock_callback.assert_called_once()
```

#### Styling Tests
Styling tests ensure that your application’s styles are applied correctly. Here’s an example:

```python
def test_element_styling():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch()
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto('http://localhost:8000')
        element = page.query_selector('#element_id')
        assert element.evaluate("el => getComputedStyle(el).color") == "rgb(255, 0, 0)"
        browser.close()
```

### Running Tests
You can run your tests using `pytest`. Simply navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
pytest
```

This command will discover and run all the tests in your project.

### Specific Use Cases

#### Simulating User Actions
You can simulate user actions such as clicking a button using `playwright`. Here’s an example:

```python
def test_button_click():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch()
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto('http://localhost:8000')
        page.click('#button_id')
        assert page.query_selector('#element_id').is_visible()
        browser.close()
```

#### Asserting the State of a Variable
You can assert the state of a variable in your GUI instance. Here’s an example:

```python
def test_variable_state():
    gui_instance.set_variable('variable_name', 'expected_value')
    assert gui_instance.get_variable('variable_name') == 'expected_value'
```

#### Checking Element Visibility
You can check if an element is visible or not. Here’s an example:

```python
def test_element_visibility():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch()
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto('http://localhost:8000')
        assert page.query_selector('#element_id').is_visible()
        browser.close()
