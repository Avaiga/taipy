### Interactive Pie Chart: Occupation Distribution

The interactive pie chart provides a visual representation of the distribution of orders across various occupations. Each segment of the pie corresponds to a specific occupation category, illustrating the proportion of orders attributed to each occupation.

<br/>
**Dynamic Interaction**<br/>

Users can engage with the pie chart by clicking on individual occupation segments. Upon clicking, the selected occupation segment is removed from the chart, dynamically adjusting the visualization to reflect the distribution of orders among the remaining occupations.

**Enhanced Insights**<br/>

This interactive feature empowers users to focus on specific occupation categories of interest, enabling deeper analysis and insights into order distribution patterns. By dynamically recalculating the chart, users gain a clearer understanding of how different occupations contribute to overall order volume.
