# Submission for the Quine quest-007

[Repository](https://quine.sh/repo/pranshu-raj-211-from_Taipy_job_tracker-774027579?utm_source=copy&utm_share_context=rdp)

Tired of searching for jobs all over the internet? This project automates the job search project by sourcing the best tech jobs available across many categories and provides them to the user with recommendations in a well structured interface.

In this project I have implemented a full data pipeline that sources data using scrapers, processes them according to simple rules then provides recommendations to the user based on some query parameters.
It features an interactive interface built using taipy which shows the jobs best suited to the user.

Please provide me with feedback on how to improve this project and feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
