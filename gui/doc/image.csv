<p>
If a buffer is provided (string, array of bytes...), and in order to prevent the bandwidth to be
consumed too much, the way the image data is transferred depends on the the <i>data_url_max_size</i>
parameter of the application configuration (which is set to 50kB by default):
<ul>
<li>If the size of the buffer is smaller than this setting, then the raw content is generated as a
  data URL, encoded using base64 (i.e. <code>""data:&lt;mimetype&gt;;base64,&lt;data&gt;""</code>).</li>
<li>If the size of the buffer is greater than this setting, then it is transferred through a temporary
  file.</li>
</ul>
